The textbook for this class was too large to upload, but it's a really great book. Maybe buy it in the future. It's called "Advanced Engineering Mathematics", and it was written by Erwin Kreyszig. We used the 9th edition. It's 1000+ pages about ODEs, Systems of ODEs, Laplace Transforms, Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, Fourier Series/Integrals/Transforms, PDEs, Complex Integration, Power/Taylor Series, Laurent Series, Residue Integration, Probability/Stats, Optimization, and Graph Theory
